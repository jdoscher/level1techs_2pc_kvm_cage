*** PRINT SUGGESTIONS ***

Printing this file successfully will depend on your printer, but the goal is to make this as easy to print as possible.  The recommended print material is PETG, but PLA can be used too- but keep in mind temperature and durability differences.  On PETG, I recommend a bare minimum of 2 walls, but 3 or 4 significantly increase rigidity.  Infill should be at least 20% and no more than 35% is needed, and I recommend rectilinear.  If you choose less than 20%, you may have issues with top and bottom exterior finish.

This design uses all M4 socket head screws and should be fine with 10mm lengths for the thinner panels, 14mm for the medium thickness panels, and 14-20mm lengths for the panel that is intended to mount to a wall.
